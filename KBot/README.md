# KBot

The project started on 23.10.2020 for learning purposes only. Stopped developing in February 2021, but the offsets are updated for patch 11.10 EUW. Only source, no binaries since it's just as a help to someone else who wants to start out.

I made it with almost no prior game hacking experience, but I'm happy with how it went out. Other than bug fixes and expanding it only evade needs some work, which I started doing with "Evade2" ("Evade" was just to understand how does it work and then rewrite it from scratch)
